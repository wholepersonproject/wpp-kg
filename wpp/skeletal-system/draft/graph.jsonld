The DCT epithelial cells form lining of the distal convoluted tubule, a segment of the nephron located after the loop of Henle and before the collecting tubule. These cells are characterized by unique morphological features such as small size, low height and fewer microvilli compared to proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. \nThese cells perform a host of vital functions contributing to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance, blood pressure and pH. While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis. In summary, kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells perform functions that are crucial to maintaining body's homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Epithelial cells of the nephron form the epithelial lining of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that filters the blood to produce urine. Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL. It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.)",

Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.\n\nCan you fix to something like:\n\nA statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.\n\nAlan Ruttenberg\n\nYour proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. \n\nOn the specifics of the proposed definition:\n\nWe don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. \n\nPersonally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. \n\nWe also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with."

We think of cartilage and bone as skeletal tissues and of enamel and dentine as dental tissues, but enamel and dentine arose evolutionarily together with bone as skeletal tissues in the dermal skeleton (exoskeleton) of early vertebrates. Scales and teeth of sharks are examples of dermal skeletal elements that are still composed of the three ancient components-enamel, dentine, and bone. Cartilage, on the other hand, provided the basis for the second vertebrate skeletal system, the endoskeleton (Smith and Hall, 1990; Hall, 1998a,b). some invertebrate skeletal tissues have surprisingly bone-like features. Examples include chondrocytes interconnected by cell processes in cephalopod cartilages (Cole and Hall, 2004a,b), and the calcium phosphate layer in the shells of brachiopods (Rodland et al., 2003). However, neither bone nor mineralized cartilage have been found in invertebrates. Editors notes: TODO - develops_from",

They represent the most common type of bone cell, making up approximately 95% of the total bone cell population in mature adult bone tissue. Osteocytes are a stellate shape with numerous long, slender dendritic processes.\nThe formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.\nThe primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.\nA remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells, which differentiate into osteoblasts under the influence of various growth factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These multipotent cells play a critical role in the bone formation process known as ossification.\nThe primary function of osteoblasts is to synthesize and deposit bone matrix, a mixture of organic substances and inorganic materials. This included producing a mix of collagen and non-collagenous proteins, which they secrete to create the organic portion of the extracellular bone matrix. The osteoblasts also initiate the mineralization process by depositing calcium and phosphate ions onto this organic matrix, generating a material that is incredibly strong and resilient, which we recognize as bone. \nFurthermore, osteoblasts are intricately involved in bone remodeling. They communicate with other specialized bone cells, like osteoclasts (involved in bone resorption) and osteocytes (derived from osteoblasts and important for bone maintenance), helping to maintain skeletal health and homeostasis. Dysregulation of osteoblast function can lead to various bone diseases, illustrating the importance of these cells in skeletal health and development.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Phagocytes circulate throughout the body, patrolling and guarding against the invasion of pathogens. They are one among many types of cells that originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.\nUpon detection of an invading microorganism, phagocytes are mobilized by inflammatory mediators (such as bacterial proteins or complement proteins) to the infection site. They recognize surface molecules, specifically antigens, on harmful bacteria or other foreign substances with the help of opsonins, which are proteins that bind to the pathogen and make them more susceptible to phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis involves the extension of the phagocyte's membrane around the microorganism, completely enclosing it within a microbicidal vacuole, the phagolysosome, which contains various microbicidal chemicals and digestive enzymes such as cathepsins, proteases, lysozymes, and lipases that may be employed to degrade the pathogen.\nPhagocytes are predominantly neutrophils or monocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte and are usually the first to arrive at the site of infection. Monocytes are derived from the bone marrow and can circulate to tissues and mature into local macrophages. Macrophages arrive later at sites of infection and are longer-lived than neutrophils. The process of phagocytosis must be tightly regulated to avoid host tissue damage.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Myeloid leukocytes are a group of immune cells descended from the myeloid lineage. The myeloid lineage constitutes a significant portion of the body's defense system, particularly against microbial pathogens and foreign substances. Myeloid leukocytes originate from hematopoietic stem cells located in the bone marrow. The commitment of a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into a myeloid progenitor cell represents the initiation step towards the development of myeloid leukocytes. Once differentiated, these cells contribute diversely to both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the body.\nMyeloid leukocytes include several distinct cell types based on functionality and structure, encompassing monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and dendritic cells. Each cell type has specialized functions, occupying a unique role in the body's immune response. For instance, neutrophils are prolific phagocytes—cells that engulf and destroy pathogens—while eosinophils are instrumental in combating multicellular parasites and modulating allergic inflammatory responses. Monocytes, in addition to their phagocytic activities, can enter peripheral tissues and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells which are crucial for antigen presentation to T cells.\nAnother critical function of myeloid leukocytes is their involvement in tissue remodeling and repair. For example, macrophages not only play a key role in defending the body but also perform duties essential for wound healing, such as removing dead cells and stimulating tissue repair. In general, myeloid leukocytes participate in the removal of old and damaged cells, an essential process for maintaining good health and homeostasis. Through the orchestration of complex interactions and signal transductions, myeloid leukocytes provide the body with a robust defense system against foreign invaders and participate in maintaining the body's overall balance and function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are primarily involved in reabsorption and secretion processes, key functions that facilitate homeostasis within the body.\nProximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells extensively function in the reabsorption process to a greater degree than their counterparts in the proximal straight tubule. Approximately two-thirds of filtrated sodium and water, nearly all nutrient sugars and amino acids, and a significant portion of bicarbonates pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, are effectively absorbed by the epithelial cells, and reenter the bodily circulation. By absorbing bicarbonates and secreting protons into the tubular fluid, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also contribute to the pH regulation in the body .\nIn addition to reabsorption, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also play a critical role in the excretion of waste metabolites and xenobiotics. These cells possess a range of transporters that secrete metabolic end products and certain drugs, hence aiding in their elimination. This function underlines their importance for body detoxification.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are distinguished from other cells by their large size and their unique ability to secrete enzymes and acids that dissolve the calcium phosphate in bone. The formation of osteoclasts is influenced by two primary factors: macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the ligand-activated receptor (RANKL) of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).\nOsteoclasts also collaborate with osteoblasts, responsible for new bone formation, to maintain bone health and adapt bone structure. Their coordinated actions allow continuous remodeling while preserving overall bone strength and integrity. Imbalances in osteoclast activity can lead to pathological conditions. For example, excessive activity may contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, periprosthetic osteolysis, bone tumors, and Paget's disease. Other the other hand, osteoclast deficiency ca result in conditions like osteopetrosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the parathyroid gland evolved as a result of the transformation of the gills into the parathyroid glands of tetrapods and the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment. This interpretation would also explain the positioning of the parathyroid gland within the pharynx in the tetrapod body. Were the parathyroid gland to have emerged de novo with the evolution of the tetrapods it could, as an endocrine organ, have been placed anywhere in the body and still exert its effect.[well established][VHOG]",

The DCT epithelial cells form lining of the distal convoluted tubule, a segment of the nephron located after the loop of Henle and before the collecting tubule. These cells are characterized by unique morphological features such as small size, low height and fewer microvilli compared to proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. \nThese cells perform a host of vital functions contributing to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance, blood pressure and pH. While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis. In summary, kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells perform functions that are crucial to maintaining body's homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells, which differentiate into osteoblasts under the influence of various growth factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These multipotent cells play a critical role in the bone formation process known as ossification.\nThe primary function of osteoblasts is to synthesize and deposit bone matrix, a mixture of organic substances and inorganic materials. This included producing a mix of collagen and non-collagenous proteins, which they secrete to create the organic portion of the extracellular bone matrix. The osteoblasts also initiate the mineralization process by depositing calcium and phosphate ions onto this organic matrix, generating a material that is incredibly strong and resilient, which we recognize as bone. \nFurthermore, osteoblasts are intricately involved in bone remodeling. They communicate with other specialized bone cells, like osteoclasts (involved in bone resorption) and osteocytes (derived from osteoblasts and important for bone maintenance), helping to maintain skeletal health and homeostasis. Dysregulation of osteoblast function can lead to various bone diseases, illustrating the importance of these cells in skeletal health and development.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Epithelial cells of the nephron form the epithelial lining of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that filters the blood to produce urine. Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The formation of osteoclasts is influenced by two primary factors: macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the ligand-activated receptor (RANKL) of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).\nOsteoclasts also collaborate with osteoblasts, responsible for new bone formation, to maintain bone health and adapt bone structure. Their coordinated actions allow continuous remodeling while preserving overall bone strength and integrity. Imbalances in osteoclast activity can lead to pathological conditions. For example, excessive activity may contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, periprosthetic osteolysis, bone tumors, and Paget's disease. Other the other hand, osteoclast deficiency ca result in conditions like osteopetrosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells play a critical role in the resorption process in the kidney and are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, including blood filtration, electrolyte balance, and acid-base balance. Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a cuboidal shape and microvilli that increase surface area, facilitating effective reabsorption.\nThe primary function of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule revolves around their ability to reabsorb approximately 60-70% of the glomerular filtrate, retaining essential substances such as sodium, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and certain ions that are filtered out by the glomerulus. Additionally, these cells are also responsible for the secretion of organic acids, bases, and the hydrolysis of small proteins that are reabsorbed after filtration. \nProximal tubule epithelial cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis, and damage to these cells by exposure to toxins, pathogens, or obstructive conditions may result in acute kidney injury.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Phagocytes are a heterogeneous group of white blood cells that have the capability to ingest, or ‘phagocytose’, foreign substances, pathogens, and cellular debris with high efficiency, thereby playing a vital role in the immune response. Phagocytes circulate throughout the body, patrolling and guarding against the invasion of pathogens. They are one among many types of cells that originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.\nUpon detection of an invading microorganism, phagocytes are mobilized by inflammatory mediators (such as bacterial proteins or complement proteins) to the infection site. They recognize surface molecules, specifically antigens, on harmful bacteria or other foreign substances with the help of opsonins, which are proteins that bind to the pathogen and make them more susceptible to phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis involves the extension of the phagocyte's membrane around the microorganism, completely enclosing it within a microbicidal vacuole, the phagolysosome, which contains various microbicidal chemicals and digestive enzymes such as cathepsins, proteases, lysozymes, and lipases that may be employed to degrade the pathogen.\nPhagocytes are predominantly neutrophils or monocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte and are usually the first to arrive at the site of infection. Monocytes are derived from the bone marrow and can circulate to tissues and mature into local macrophages. Macrophages arrive later at sites of infection and are longer-lived than neutrophils. The process of phagocytosis must be tightly regulated to avoid host tissue damage.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Myeloid leukocytes are a group of immune cells descended from the myeloid lineage. The myeloid lineage constitutes a significant portion of the body's defense system, particularly against microbial pathogens and foreign substances. Myeloid leukocytes originate from hematopoietic stem cells located in the bone marrow. The commitment of a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into a myeloid progenitor cell represents the initiation step towards the development of myeloid leukocytes. Once differentiated, these cells contribute diversely to both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the body.\nMyeloid leukocytes include several distinct cell types based on functionality and structure, encompassing monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and dendritic cells. Each cell type has specialized functions, occupying a unique role in the body's immune response. For instance, neutrophils are prolific phagocytes—cells that engulf and destroy pathogens—while eosinophils are instrumental in combating multicellular parasites and modulating allergic inflammatory responses. Monocytes, in addition to their phagocytic activities, can enter peripheral tissues and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells which are crucial for antigen presentation to T cells.\nAnother critical function of myeloid leukocytes is their involvement in tissue remodeling and repair. For example, macrophages not only play a key role in defending the body but also perform duties essential for wound healing, such as removing dead cells and stimulating tissue repair. In general, myeloid leukocytes participate in the removal of old and damaged cells, an essential process for maintaining good health and homeostasis. Through the orchestration of complex interactions and signal transductions, myeloid leukocytes provide the body with a robust defense system against foreign invaders and participate in maintaining the body's overall balance and function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are primarily involved in reabsorption and secretion processes, key functions that facilitate homeostasis within the body.\nProximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells extensively function in the reabsorption process to a greater degree than their counterparts in the proximal straight tubule. Approximately two-thirds of filtrated sodium and water, nearly all nutrient sugars and amino acids, and a significant portion of bicarbonates pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, are effectively absorbed by the epithelial cells, and reenter the bodily circulation. By absorbing bicarbonates and secreting protons into the tubular fluid, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also contribute to the pH regulation in the body .\nIn addition to reabsorption, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also play a critical role in the excretion of waste metabolites and xenobiotics. These cells possess a range of transporters that secrete metabolic end products and certain drugs, hence aiding in their elimination. This function underlines their importance for body detoxification.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They represent the most common type of bone cell, making up approximately 95% of the total bone cell population in mature adult bone tissue. Osteocytes are a stellate shape with numerous long, slender dendritic processes.\nThe formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.\nThe primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.\nA remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells play a critical role in the resorption process in the kidney and are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, including blood filtration, electrolyte balance, and acid-base balance. Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a cuboidal shape and microvilli that increase surface area, facilitating effective reabsorption.\nThe primary function of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule revolves around their ability to reabsorb approximately 60-70% of the glomerular filtrate, retaining essential substances such as sodium, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and certain ions that are filtered out by the glomerulus. Additionally, these cells are also responsible for the secretion of organic acids, bases, and the hydrolysis of small proteins that are reabsorbed after filtration. \nProximal tubule epithelial cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis, and damage to these cells by exposure to toxins, pathogens, or obstructive conditions may result in acute kidney injury.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.
