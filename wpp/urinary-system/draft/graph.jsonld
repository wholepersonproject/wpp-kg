These cells play a critical role in the resorption process in the kidney and are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, including blood filtration, electrolyte balance, and acid-base balance. Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a cuboidal shape and microvilli that increase surface area, facilitating effective reabsorption.\nThe primary function of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule revolves around their ability to reabsorb approximately 60-70% of the glomerular filtrate, retaining essential substances such as sodium, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and certain ions that are filtered out by the glomerulus. Additionally, these cells are also responsible for the secretion of organic acids, bases, and the hydrolysis of small proteins that are reabsorbed after filtration. \nProximal tubule epithelial cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis, and damage to these cells by exposure to toxins, pathogens, or obstructive conditions may result in acute kidney injury.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.\n\nCan you fix to something like:\n\nA statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.\n\nAlan Ruttenberg\n\nYour proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. \n\nOn the specifics of the proposed definition:\n\nWe don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. \n\nPersonally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. \n\nWe also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with."

These cells are primarily involved in reabsorption and secretion processes, key functions that facilitate homeostasis within the body.\nProximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells extensively function in the reabsorption process to a greater degree than their counterparts in the proximal straight tubule. Approximately two-thirds of filtrated sodium and water, nearly all nutrient sugars and amino acids, and a significant portion of bicarbonates pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, are effectively absorbed by the epithelial cells, and reenter the bodily circulation. By absorbing bicarbonates and secreting protons into the tubular fluid, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also contribute to the pH regulation in the body .\nIn addition to reabsorption, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also play a critical role in the excretion of waste metabolites and xenobiotics. These cells possess a range of transporters that secrete metabolic end products and certain drugs, hence aiding in their elimination. This function underlines their importance for body detoxification.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells, which make up the macula densa, help regulate blood pressure and the filtration rate of the glomerulus by sensing sodium chloride amounts in the kidney tubules. Found where the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle touches the afferent arteriole, macula densa epithelial cells are positioned in an optimal location to monitor and respond to changes in the filtrate composition.\nThese cells maintain intraglomerular homeostasis. When the sodium chloride concentration is high, macula densa cells respond by secreting adenosine and vasoconstricting the afferent arteriole to decrease the glomerular filtration rate. Conversely, if the sodium chloride concentration in the filtrate is low, the production and release of nitric oxide cause vasodilation to enhance the glomerular filtration rate. \nMacula densa epithelial cells also have a role in tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, an essential autoregulatory renal response. They send feedback to the glomerular mesangial cells, allowing constriction or relaxation of the afferent arteriole as needed depending on the content of the filtrate.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells, often referred to simply as distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells, constitute a significant portion of the nephron -- the functional building unit of the kidney involved in filtration and reabsorption of substances from blood. The DCT epithelial cells form lining of the distal convoluted tubule, a segment of the nephron located after the loop of Henle and before the collecting tubule. These cells are characterized by unique morphological features such as small size, low height and fewer microvilli compared to proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. \nThese cells perform a host of vital functions contributing to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance, blood pressure and pH. While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis. In summary, kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells perform functions that are crucial to maintaining body's homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Principal cells are located at the final segments of the renal tubules, where they play a pivotal role in key homeostatic processes.\nOne of their fundamental functions of kidney collecting duct principal cells is the regulation of water reabsorption, which is mediated by aquaporins (water channel proteins). Antidiuretic hormones, such as vasopressin, can stimulate the redistribution of these water channels from an intracellular pools to the apical plasma membrane of the principal cell; translocation of aquaporin (specifically, AQP2) is associated with an increase of osmotic water permeability. The water reabsorption affects the concentration of the final urine; these cells are therefore directly involved in the maintenance of the body's fluid balance.\nKidney collecting duct principal cells also participate in sodium and potassium ions regulation. They reabsorb sodium ions from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream, a process facilitated by the action of aldosterone, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Similarly, the principal cells secrete potassium ions into the tubular fluid in response to aldosterone, contributing to the regulation of potassium levels in the body. Impaired function of cells can lead to various renal diseases and disorders, highlighting the vital role of kidney collecting duct principal cells in the body's homeostatic processes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell.

            "dct:description": "Podocytes are highly specialized, terminally differentiated glomerular visceral epithelial cells that wrap around the capillaries in the kidneys. They play an essential role in kidney function, particularly in the filtration selectivity of the glomerulus. Each podocyte is characterized by a unique architecture with a large cell body, ‘major processes’ extending outwardly from the cell body and ‘foot processes’, also known as pedicels, which surround. the glomerular capillary loops\nPodocytes represent the last barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane in the kidney. This barrier prevents the leakage of plasma proteins from the blood into the urine, hence maintaining protein homeostasis in the body. The foot processes of the podocytes interdigitate with those from neighboring cells. The cell-cell junctions between the foot processes, the slit-diaphragms, are thought to create a molecular sensor of renal filtration that prevents the passage of macromolecules while allowing water and small solutes to pass.\nPodocytes also contribute to the glomerular basement membrane by secreting collagen and maintain glomerular endothelial cell fenestration by secreting VEGFA. They have been shown to play a role in inducing cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response, consistent with their essential function in the kidney. \nThe importance of podocytes is further emphasized by the effects of their damage or loss. Abnormalities in podocytes often result in severe kidney diseases (podocytopathies), including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD). Injury to the podocytes can result in \"effacement\" or flattening of foot processes, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier and proteinuria (an excess of serum protein in urine) which is a common symptom of kidney diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "The kidney interstitial fibroblasts are crucial cells found predominantly in the interstitium of the kidneys. These cells play a significant role in maintaining kidney structure and orchestrating key physiological procedures related to kidney function. The interstitium forms a complex network with other cells, capillaries, and the renal tubules, which are crucial for maintaining kidney functions.\nFunctionally, these cells participate in renal homeostasis by synthesizing and secreting vital extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, proteoglycan, and fibronectin, which contribute to the structural integrity of the kidneys. Additionally, these fibroblasts provide supportive tissues to nephrons (structural and functional units of kidneys), help in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, along with providing an arena for immune response in case of any infection or damage. They are also integral to the regulation of kidney blood flow and maintenance of tubular structures by stabilizing capillaries through synthesis of angiogenic factors.\nUnder pathological conditions, such as renal fibrosis, kidney interstitial fibroblasts can transform into myofibroblasts, which speed up the production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. This overproduction can lead to scar formation and affect the kidney's functionality, often leading to a chronic and progressive loss of renal function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Located in the collecting duct system of the kidneys, these cells are responsible for one of the final steps in the process of urine formation, and they are instrumental in the fine tuning of the volume and composition of urine by reabsorbing water and certain solutes back into the bloodstream.\nThese cells express specific channels and carriers that actively and passively transport ions and water. They also have channels on their membranes, such as sodium channels and potassium channels, involved in reabsorbing or secreting these electrolytes depending upon the body's needs. The function of renal collecting duct epithelial cells can be regulated by a variety of hormones, including vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which can modulate the ion channels and carriers and hence indirectly influence body fluid homeostasis.\nAside from their function in ion and water balance, kidney collecting duct epithelial cells also aid in maintaining the body's acid-base balance. They have specialized functionality to secret hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen, which contributes to acid excretion. Any dysfunction may have serious implications and lead to various renal or systemic diseases, exemplifying the importance of these cells in maintaining overall body homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus lies adjacent to the glomerulus and regulates kidney function by maintaining the blood flow to the kidney and the filtration rate[GO]. a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of each nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus: it is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The three cellular components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells (also known as granular cells)[WP].",

They are unique endothelial cells found lining the walls of efferent arterioles, which transport blood away from the glomeruli in the kidney.\nThe primary responsibilities of the kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells involve controling renal blood flow, regulating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and managing perfusion pressure. They do this by contracting and relaxing, effectively narrowing and widening the arteriole's lumen thereby controling the volume and rate of blood flow to the peritubular capillaries and creating the pressure gradient necessary for filtration in the glomerulus. \nFurthermore, kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells show a high degree of plasticity in response to pathophysiological stimuli and can undergo structural and functional changes based on local needs. In conditions like hypertension and diabetes, these cells can experience hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, contributing to the progression of renal disease.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.\nFurthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Endothelial cells of the vascular tree, commonly referred to as vascular endothelial cells, line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to the smallest capillaries. These cells have a unique, flattened shape, and are tightly bound together, forming a thin layer known as the endothelium. The endothelium is responsible for maintaining the interior surface of blood vessels, and plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth flow of blood. \nVascular endothelial cells act as a semi-permeable membrane, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.\nFurthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Smooth muscle cells are a specialized type of muscle cells that are primarily found within the walls of hollow organs such as the intestine, stomach, bladder, uterus, and blood vessels. These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.\nSmooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.\nOn a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Each is directed across the crus of the diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The renal arteries carry a large portion of total blood flow to the kidneys. Up to a third of total cardiac output can pass through the renal arteries to be filtered by the kidneys. The arterial supply of the kidneys is variable and there may be one or more renal arteries supplying each kidney. It is located above the renal vein. It has a radius of approximately 0.25cm, 0.26 cm at the root. The measured mean diameter can differ depending on the imaging method used. For example, the diameter was found to be 5.04 ± 0.74 mm using ultrasound, but 5.68 ± 1.19 mm using angiography. [WP,unvetted].[Wikipedia]"

Located in the collecting duct system of the kidneys, these cells are responsible for one of the final steps in the process of urine formation, and they are instrumental in the fine tuning of the volume and composition of urine by reabsorbing water and certain solutes back into the bloodstream.\nThese cells express specific channels and carriers that actively and passively transport ions and water. They also have channels on their membranes, such as sodium channels and potassium channels, involved in reabsorbing or secreting these electrolytes depending upon the body's needs. The function of renal collecting duct epithelial cells can be regulated by a variety of hormones, including vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which can modulate the ion channels and carriers and hence indirectly influence body fluid homeostasis.\nAside from their function in ion and water balance, kidney collecting duct epithelial cells also aid in maintaining the body's acid-base balance. They have specialized functionality to secret hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen, which contributes to acid excretion. Any dysfunction may have serious implications and lead to various renal or systemic diseases, exemplifying the importance of these cells in maintaining overall body homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The NR family includes ligand-bound and orphan receptors, that is, receptors with no known ligand or for which there is no ligand Pocket. Understanding NR evolution has been further improved by comparison of several completed genomes, particularly those of deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. In contrast, evolution of NR ligands is still much debated. One hypothesis proposes that several independent gains and losses of ligand-binding ability in NRs occurred in protostomes and deuterostomes. A second hypothesis, pertaining to the NR3 subfamily (vertebrate steroid hormone receptors and estrogen related receptor), proposes that before the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, there was an ancestral steroid receptor (AncSR) that was ligand-activated and that orphan receptors secondarily lost the ability to bind a ligand.

Nuclear receptors (NRs), a metazoan-specific family of ligand-activated transcription factors, play central roles in endocrine responses, as intermediates between signaling molecules and target genes. The NR family includes ligand-bound and orphan receptors, that is, receptors with no known ligand or for which there is no ligand Pocket. Understanding NR evolution has been further improved by comparison of several completed genomes, particularly those of deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. In contrast, evolution of NR ligands is still much debated. One hypothesis proposes that several independent gains and losses of ligand-binding ability in NRs occurred in protostomes and deuterostomes. A second hypothesis, pertaining to the NR3 subfamily (vertebrate steroid hormone receptors and estrogen related receptor), proposes that before the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, there was an ancestral steroid receptor (AncSR) that was ligand-activated and that orphan receptors secondarily lost the ability to bind a ligand. (...) Our analysis reveals that steroidogenesis has been independently elaborated in the 3 main bilaterian lineages (...).[well established][VHOG]",

Each is directed across the crus of the diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The renal arteries carry a large portion of total blood flow to the kidneys. Up to a third of total cardiac output can pass through the renal arteries to be filtered by the kidneys. The arterial supply of the kidneys is variable and there may be one or more renal arteries supplying each kidney. It is located above the renal vein. It has a radius of approximately 0.25cm, 0.26 cm at the root. The measured mean diameter can differ depending on the imaging method used. For example, the diameter was found to be 5.04 ± 0.74 mm using ultrasound, but 5.68 ± 1.19 mm using angiography. [WP,unvetted].[Wikipedia]",

These cells are primarily involved in reabsorption and secretion processes, key functions that facilitate homeostasis within the body.\nProximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells extensively function in the reabsorption process to a greater degree than their counterparts in the proximal straight tubule. Approximately two-thirds of filtrated sodium and water, nearly all nutrient sugars and amino acids, and a significant portion of bicarbonates pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, are effectively absorbed by the epithelial cells, and reenter the bodily circulation. By absorbing bicarbonates and secreting protons into the tubular fluid, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also contribute to the pH regulation in the body .\nIn addition to reabsorption, proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells also play a critical role in the excretion of waste metabolites and xenobiotics. These cells possess a range of transporters that secrete metabolic end products and certain drugs, hence aiding in their elimination. This function underlines their importance for body detoxification.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells form a single, continuous monolayer inside every blood vessel, acting as a crucial biomolecular barrier between the blood, and the rest of the body tissues. They perform various fundamental biological functions, ranging from maintenance of vessel integrity to blood clotting regulation. Additionally, they control the transportation of fluids, molecules, and blood particulate matter from and into the bloodstream.\nOne of the primary functions of blood vessel endothelial cells is to maintain vascular homeostasis - a stable environment within the blood vessels. They accomplish this through several methods: they control vasomotor tone, i.e. the degree of contraction and dilation of blood vessels, by secreting vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin; mediate responses to inflammatory stimuli; and they also regulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formations. Blood vessel endothelial cells play a significant role in preventing blood clot formation by generating a slick, non-thrombogenic surface that disallows platelets or coagulant proteins from adhering to it.\nBlood vessel endothelial cells are sensitive to various stimuli, including shear stress caused by blood flow, and they can respond by altering their morphology, function, and gene expression. This ability to adapt enables blood vessels to remodel and ensure the adequate delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues, regardless of physiological demand variations. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction, often associated with a reduction in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, can lead to the development of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and even aging-related diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Epithelial cells of the nephron form the epithelial lining of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that filters the blood to produce urine. Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells play a critical role in the resorption process in the kidney and are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, including blood filtration, electrolyte balance, and acid-base balance. Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a cuboidal shape and microvilli that increase surface area, facilitating effective reabsorption.\nThe primary function of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule revolves around their ability to reabsorb approximately 60-70% of the glomerular filtrate, retaining essential substances such as sodium, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and certain ions that are filtered out by the glomerulus. Additionally, these cells are also responsible for the secretion of organic acids, bases, and the hydrolysis of small proteins that are reabsorbed after filtration. \nProximal tubule epithelial cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis, and damage to these cells by exposure to toxins, pathogens, or obstructive conditions may result in acute kidney injury.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Epithelial cells of the nephron form the epithelial lining of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that filters the blood to produce urine. Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels, which facilitate the reabsorption of water from the fluid within the renal tubule lumen back into the blood. The translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane is controlled by the hormone vasopressin: In response to high vasopressin levels, AQP2 moves to the cell membrane, allowing water to pass through effectively and be reabsorbed, therefore concentrating the urine. Conversely, in low vasopressin conditions, AQP2 is removed from the membrane, reducing water reabsorption and diluting the urine. \nRenal principal cells are also involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. They have sodium channels (ENaC) in their luminal membranes which permit the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubule fluid back into the blood, resulting in a net reabsorption of sodium ions into the systemic circulation. This process is controlled, in part, by the hormone aldosterone. Additionally, renal principal cells contain potassium channels that facilitate the secretion of potassium ions into the urine. The activities of these channels, in coordination with other cell types in the nephron, are critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and overall body homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "dct:description": "Renal principal cells are the major cell type in the initial collecting tubule and the cortical and outer medullary collecting ducts, as well as the connecting tubule, in the nephrons of the kidneys.\nA key function of renal principal cells is the regulation of water balance in the body. These cells express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels, which facilitate the reabsorption of water from the fluid within the renal tubule lumen back into the blood. The translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane is controlled by the hormone vasopressin: In response to high vasopressin levels, AQP2 moves to the cell membrane, allowing water to pass through effectively and be reabsorbed, therefore concentrating the urine. Conversely, in low vasopressin conditions, AQP2 is removed from the membrane, reducing water reabsorption and diluting the urine. \nRenal principal cells are also involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. They have sodium channels (ENaC) in their luminal membranes which permit the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubule fluid back into the blood, resulting in a net reabsorption of sodium ions into the systemic circulation. This process is controlled, in part, by the hormone aldosterone. Additionally, renal principal cells contain potassium channels that facilitate the secretion of potassium ions into the urine. The activities of these channels, in coordination with other cell types in the nephron, are critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and overall body homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Blood vessel endothelial cells, also known as vascular endothelial cells, form the delicate inner lining of the complex circulatory system, including arteries and veins. These cells form a single, continuous monolayer inside every blood vessel, acting as a crucial biomolecular barrier between the blood, and the rest of the body tissues. They perform various fundamental biological functions, ranging from maintenance of vessel integrity to blood clotting regulation. Additionally, they control the transportation of fluids, molecules, and blood particulate matter from and into the bloodstream.\nOne of the primary functions of blood vessel endothelial cells is to maintain vascular homeostasis - a stable environment within the blood vessels. They accomplish this through several methods: they control vasomotor tone, i.e. the degree of contraction and dilation of blood vessels, by secreting vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin; mediate responses to inflammatory stimuli; and they also regulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formations. Blood vessel endothelial cells play a significant role in preventing blood clot formation by generating a slick, non-thrombogenic surface that disallows platelets or coagulant proteins from adhering to it.\nBlood vessel endothelial cells are sensitive to various stimuli, including shear stress caused by blood flow, and they can respond by altering their morphology, function, and gene expression. This ability to adapt enables blood vessels to remodel and ensure the adequate delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues, regardless of physiological demand variations. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction, often associated with a reduction in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, can lead to the development of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and even aging-related diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are unique endothelial cells found lining the walls of efferent arterioles, which transport blood away from the glomeruli in the kidney.\nThe primary responsibilities of the kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells involve controling renal blood flow, regulating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and managing perfusion pressure. They do this by contracting and relaxing, effectively narrowing and widening the arteriole's lumen thereby controling the volume and rate of blood flow to the peritubular capillaries and creating the pressure gradient necessary for filtration in the glomerulus. \nFurthermore, kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells show a high degree of plasticity in response to pathophysiological stimuli and can undergo structural and functional changes based on local needs. In conditions like hypertension and diabetes, these cells can experience hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, contributing to the progression of renal disease.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.\nSmooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.\nOn a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "The kidney collecting duct principal cell is a highly specialized type of cell found in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney's nephron. Principal cells are located at the final segments of the renal tubules, where they play a pivotal role in key homeostatic processes.\nOne of their fundamental functions of kidney collecting duct principal cells is the regulation of water reabsorption, which is mediated by aquaporins (water channel proteins). Antidiuretic hormones, such as vasopressin, can stimulate the redistribution of these water channels from an intracellular pools to the apical plasma membrane of the principal cell; translocation of aquaporin (specifically, AQP2) is associated with an increase of osmotic water permeability. The water reabsorption affects the concentration of the final urine; these cells are therefore directly involved in the maintenance of the body's fluid balance.\nKidney collecting duct principal cells also participate in sodium and potassium ions regulation. They reabsorb sodium ions from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream, a process facilitated by the action of aldosterone, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Similarly, the principal cells secrete potassium ions into the tubular fluid in response to aldosterone, contributing to the regulation of potassium levels in the body. Impaired function of cells can lead to various renal diseases and disorders, highlighting the vital role of kidney collecting duct principal cells in the body's homeostatic processes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "Podocytes are highly specialized, terminally differentiated glomerular visceral epithelial cells that wrap around the capillaries in the kidneys. They play an essential role in kidney function, particularly in the filtration selectivity of the glomerulus. Each podocyte is characterized by a unique architecture with a large cell body, ‘major processes’ extending outwardly from the cell body and ‘foot processes’, also known as pedicels, which surround. the glomerular capillary loops\nPodocytes represent the last barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane in the kidney. This barrier prevents the leakage of plasma proteins from the blood into the urine, hence maintaining protein homeostasis in the body. The foot processes of the podocytes interdigitate with those from neighboring cells. The cell-cell junctions between the foot processes, the slit-diaphragms, are thought to create a molecular sensor of renal filtration that prevents the passage of macromolecules while allowing water and small solutes to pass.\nPodocytes also contribute to the glomerular basement membrane by secreting collagen and maintain glomerular endothelial cell fenestration by secreting VEGFA. They have been shown to play a role in inducing cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response, consistent with their essential function in the kidney. \nThe importance of podocytes is further emphasized by the effects of their damage or loss. Abnormalities in podocytes often result in severe kidney diseases (podocytopathies), including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD). Injury to the podocytes can result in \"effacement\" or flattening of foot processes, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier and proteinuria (an excess of serum protein in urine) which is a common symptom of kidney diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are characterized by unique morphological features such as small size, low height and fewer microvilli compared to proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. \nThese cells perform a host of vital functions contributing to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance, blood pressure and pH. While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis. In summary, kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells perform functions that are crucial to maintaining body's homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

            "owl:annotatedTarget": "The kidney interstitial fibroblasts are crucial cells found predominantly in the interstitium of the kidneys. These cells play a significant role in maintaining kidney structure and orchestrating key physiological procedures related to kidney function. The interstitium forms a complex network with other cells, capillaries, and the renal tubules, which are crucial for maintaining kidney functions.\nFunctionally, these cells participate in renal homeostasis by synthesizing and secreting vital extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, proteoglycan, and fibronectin, which contribute to the structural integrity of the kidneys. Additionally, these fibroblasts provide supportive tissues to nephrons (structural and functional units of kidneys), help in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, along with providing an arena for immune response in case of any infection or damage. They are also integral to the regulation of kidney blood flow and maintenance of tubular structures by stabilizing capillaries through synthesis of angiogenic factors.\nUnder pathological conditions, such as renal fibrosis, kidney interstitial fibroblasts can transform into myofibroblasts, which speed up the production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. This overproduction can lead to scar formation and affect the kidney's functionality, often leading to a chronic and progressive loss of renal function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells, which make up the macula densa, help regulate blood pressure and the filtration rate of the glomerulus by sensing sodium chloride amounts in the kidney tubules. Found where the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle touches the afferent arteriole, macula densa epithelial cells are positioned in an optimal location to monitor and respond to changes in the filtrate composition.\nThese cells maintain intraglomerular homeostasis. When the sodium chloride concentration is high, macula densa cells respond by secreting adenosine and vasoconstricting the afferent arteriole to decrease the glomerular filtration rate. Conversely, if the sodium chloride concentration in the filtrate is low, the production and release of nitric oxide cause vasodilation to enhance the glomerular filtration rate. \nMacula densa epithelial cells also have a role in tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, an essential autoregulatory renal response. They send feedback to the glomerular mesangial cells, allowing constriction or relaxation of the afferent arteriole as needed depending on the content of the filtrate.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.
